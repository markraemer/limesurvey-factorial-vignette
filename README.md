# LimeSurvey Factorial Vignette Survey
This framework is building on the great work by Lindsay Stevens (https://github.com/lindsay-stevens/limesurveyrc2api)

I required a survey platform to host a factorial vignette survey with full flexibility of factors across vignettes. Additionally, I required information being 'piped' from answers of questions to the following. After discovering LimeSurvey and it's API, I used jinja2 in Python to generate the survey. Some additional scripts and routines for deployment were added later.

The templates support the following question types on LimeSurvey
- array
- array (texts)
- List (dropdown) 
- List (radio) 
- Ranking
