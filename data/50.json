How can they make it work? </br></br> Claudia, Adam, Marcus, and Monica installed smart lights in the hall and the living room. They can remote control the light, change the color and turn it on or off. For the remote control to work, the wall light switches need to remain in the 'on' position at all times. However, one of the residents has the habit of using the wall switches to turn off the lights. As a result, other residents find themselves unable to use the remote control to turn the lights back on.",
