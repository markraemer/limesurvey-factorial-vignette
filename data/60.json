One of them struggles with using them. What should he do?<br><br> John and his partner recently installed some smart plugs to remote control standard lamps in the living room - in addition to the normal lights. Using an app on their mobile phones they can switch the sockets and therefore the lights on and off. John hasn't installed the app on his phone, so he can't remote control the lights. His partner, however, has and uses them a lot. John finds himself in a situation where he wants to use the lights, but his partner isn't home.",
